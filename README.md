this is my website. in the future (when i learn how to code in html) i will use the website to:

- upload mods that i made
- make a blog / public diary
- promote random shite that i find (i purposefully say shite instead of shit btw)
- complain about idiots / jerks (not gonna mention any names (JKZ))

welp, look forward to it i guess
