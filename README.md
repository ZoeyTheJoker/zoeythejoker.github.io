this is my website. in the future i will use the website to:

- upload mods that i made
- make a blog / public diary where i complain about idiots / <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=jimmykaz&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">jerks</a> and promote random shite that i find interesting
- have a gallery of mii renders / random 3d model redners that i made.
- feature yet another gallery specifically for my OCii's / mii characters (idk why everyone calls their mii oc's CPU miis as opposed to just calling them oc's)
- and a bunch of other stuff that i have yet to announce

welp, look forward to it i guess
