this is my website. in the future i will use the website to:

- upload mods that i made
- promote random shite that i find interesting
- have a gallery of mii renders / random 3d model redners that i made.
- feature yet another gallery specifically for my OCii's / mii characters (idk why everyone calls their mii oc's CPU miis as opposed to just calling them oc's)
- and a bunch of other stuff that i have yet to announce

welp, look forward to it i guess
