Hello m'lady/sir/person. If you're this, then you are probably wondering why I haven't
uploaded anything for the Melodii page on GameBanana (or anywhere else).
<p>
No, Melodii has not been cancelled (again), however it has been put on a hiatus.
Well, kind of. Without leaking anything, we (The Melodii Team) decided to "restart"
Melodii. By that, I mean just completely revamp what we already had. The name, the 
songs, the stages, everything. Of course, I cant get into too much detail as to what
we've changed, as that would be against the rules.
</p>
<p>
Another reason for the delay of Melodii is because the original team (without naming specific people)
has been burnt out from modding Wii Music (I am no exception), and I dont want to force
people to work on a mod that they don't want to work on. For the majority of my modding career,
I've mainly been modding Wii Music. Not only was Wii Music a very difficult game to mod,
(its was very anti-noob friendly before Benjamin Halko made the WiiMusicEditor), but
nobody really plays Wii Music as much as I (and the og team) have.</p>
<p style="font-size:35pt;">
HOWEVER!!
</p>
<p>
I was determined to make a mod that at least <i>somebody</i> would play and enjoy, thus
I never gave up on Melodii. "bUt ZoEy, WhY wIi MuSiC?!", Wii Music has always been one
of my favorite games, even though the game is kind of trash, and I've always wanted to
make it special (to me at least). When RiiMajor (another wii music mod) was announced,
that made me very ecstatic to start making my own mods for the Wii (as opposed to just downloading
RiiConnect24 and being satisfied.) I could mod another game, but I truly wanted to mod
Wii Music because... actually, I dont really know why Wii Music was my first choice. That's
besides the point (this whole rant is besides the point)</p>
<p>
To put it simply, I will be continuing Melodii's legacy. All by myself (unless the og devs
want to come back). Yes, unfortunately, this does mean that there will be only 1 song pack
(for now...), But I promise that I will try to make Melodii a better mod than it was (im
not trying to diss anything that the old devs have already made).
</p>
<p>
I must also make this one thing clear. </p>
<p style=" color:red;">
I'm currently not looking for anyone to join the team at the moment. But when the time
comes and I start recruting people, I cant stress this enough, IF YOU HAVE NO CLUE
HOW TO MOD WII GAMES, AND YOU JUST WANT SUGGESTIONS FOR ME TO ADD... <p style="font-size:25pt; color:#bf6d00;">
(i dont mean you cant suggest anything to me, but if you join the team, and you only make requests then pay attention.)</p>
<p style="color:red;">
...DO NOT ASK TO JOIN THE TEAM! It's difficult to work with people who don't understand how to mod (again, im not dissing
any of the old team members) </p>
<p>
Anyways... Please look forward to the next update of Melodii! If you have questions, DM me on discord <a style="color:#7289da;">ZoeyTheJoker#8197</a> (dont be a dick with your questions)
