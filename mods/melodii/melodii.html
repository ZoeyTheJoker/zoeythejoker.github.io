About the future of Melodii...
</h1>
<h2 style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:20pt; color:yellow;" align="center">
welp, i knew this day would come, again. i have decided to cancel Melodii, again.
<p>
i'm currently working on a super secret (you're never gonna guess what it is) project atm,
and melodii would clash with this project. also, wii music is a really tedious game to mod,
and it has caused me to have several stress-induced panic attacks (i've also lost all
motivation to continue wii music modding) . for the sake of my 
mental stability, i have to cancel melodii. i'm sorry that i have to announce this
(especially right after beta64 reviewed melodii). please dont be mad at me for this
sudden decision.
